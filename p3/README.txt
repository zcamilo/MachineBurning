Useful information before starting the project:

For this project, the train and test data are in format .h5 which is a data storage format when the data is big. In order to load this kind of files we will need the python library h5py. Also, for this task we have to train neural networks and I think we should keep working on Python, so we should install the following two libraries Theano and Lasagne (In that order).
For the Theano library to work faster, you need to install a library called MKL form Anaconda; if you register in Anaconda Cloud with the ETH email, you get a free license (the library is not free) to install this library. This is all for Mac OSX, but I guess is very similar for Windows (for Tamas).

Link with instructions on how to get the free license for the MKL license:

Feel free, of course, to make any suggestions if you wish to work with other software.
